# labour-migration
Project for agent-based modeling course for social scientists with University of Southampton


## Migration and labour market
Main question: Do people decide to migrate / how the decision to migrate is influenced by compatriot networks in foreign country

### Decisions to take:
    - migrate or not

### Decision influence:
    - % of compatriots empolyed in foreign country
    - distance

### Agent Characteristics:
Our agents will enter the when they turn 18, and exit upon 65 or retirement (whichever comes first)
    - employment status (unemployed, fully employed, part-time)
    - age
    - sex
    - nationality
    - current location

### Agent Interactions:
    - influence others in your network on migration decision
        - e.g. come to this new place, it's great or no please do migrate

### Time:
Still in development, but we need time for:
    - when agents interact with eachother (how long are you in a place before you influence your network)
    - decision to migrate after interaction with other agents
    - become employed or remain unemployed in some X amount of time
    - some agents enter job market (turn 18 and start looking fo a job in home country or abroad) some other exit the market (turn 65 and retire)

### Environment impacts:
    - Physical distance between origin and destionation country
    -Social (number of people in your network that already migrated)
    -Economic environment (e.g. GDP, income per capita, overall unemployment rate)
